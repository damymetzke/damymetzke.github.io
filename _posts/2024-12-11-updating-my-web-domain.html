title: Updating my web domain
---
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It has been a while since I bought by domain.
I never really did anything in terms of web hosting, although I tried a few times.
There are also a couple of reasons why I want to change my domain registrar.
That is why I have decided to resolve this issue once and for all.
This post that you are reading, is the actualization of that decision.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_email">Email</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before touching on my website, let&#8217;s consider email.
One thing I used my domain for was email, although I never put much thought in it.
I used to provided email services with the hosting provider I signed up for.
Switching providers means switching email providers.
This has been a major reason why I have been slow to change things.
It would be a pain to switch email providers, only for that change to come with some issue.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After a bunch of comparisons, I ended up choosing for <a href="https://proton.me/mail">Proton Mail</a>.
I can&#8217;t say for sure if it&#8217;s the best option out there, but I can provide my reasons for choosing them.
The first is that, while I encourage the ability to self-host things, I don&#8217;t think that is preferable by default.
Some may like to tinker, I prefer for a simple solution that doesn&#8217;t waste my time.
I only tinker when I believe I can make some sort of meaningful progress in some way.
And while I have many ideas that could improve email, I don&#8217;t have the means to achieve them.
Due to prioritizing more achievable goals, I chose to go with something that works.
Proton also has a suite of other tools that will come in handy.
Such as a calendar, allowing me to get rid of yet one other Google service.
And the pricing seems fair to me, although pricing was never the primary issue for me.
All options I&#8217;ve considered were affordable and I would have chosen them if they provided me with what I need.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_web_site">Web site</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ve never done anything meaningful with my website.
And I&#8217;ve always lacked a clear goal to use it for.
After I decided to switch email, I also had to decide what to do with the website.
Some thinking later I decided that I would turn it into a blog.
I don&#8217;t think putting my resume on my website will yield much practical benefit.
Also, I have a lot of thoughts I&#8217;d like to write somewhere.
With this, I can write it down and link people whenever I have already cover something.
I don&#8217;t expect to get followers or promote my site or anything.
My primary goal is so I can link posts to others.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Again, I can provide so many reasons to write a custom solution.
But this would again take too much time.
So in the spirit of allowing me to solve more interesting problems, I decided to focus on simplicity.
My solution, is <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.
This allows me to host a site without having to consider hosting.
I also can use Git to manage to site, something I&#8217;m proficient at.
After finding a Jekyll theme I liked, I set up the site.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There was one step I did choose to include.
This is some work, but it&#8217;s relatively simple.
I decided that I prefer to write my posts using <a href="https://asciidoc.org/">AsciiDoc</a>.
So I wrote a tool called ad-blog, which can publish blogs from an AsciiDoc source.
The way it does this is by using a standard way to store the source, which can then be exported.
For now, it can be injected into a Jekyll site, which is done by converting it to HTML.
It adds one step, but that is a small price to pay.
An added bonus is that if I want to switch to something else, I just need to modify the tool.</p>
